/*
  Provides a timing utility to record and output timing of operations.

  The output can be controlled using this function:
    SetTimingVerbosity(verbosity)
  Details of each level of verbosity can be found below

  By default the timing functions record on process 0 of MPI_COMM_WORLD.
  Recording can be enabled and disabled on each process using these functions:
    EnableTiming() - enable calling process to record timing
    DisableTiming() - disable calling process to record timing

  To record timing of an operation use:
    RecordTime(string, seconds, prebarrierTime (optional))
  This will accumulate all calls with the same `string` and if verbosity is set high enough print a message with the provided timing

  To print the accumulated timing information you can call either:
    SummarizeTime() - prints timing info for enabled processes
    SummarizeTimeAcrossProcesses() - prints averaged timing info over all enabled processes

    0  - Summarized statistics at the end of simulation (default)
    1  - Output on each call to RecordTime
